My name is Víctor Adrián Suárez Ruiz, but I really like my nickname Big Thor, so I use it a lot. \
I love video games, and this made me focus my career of Computer Engineering into the video game development area.

## I am currently working on 💻
Personal projects and courses, since I am not employed as of right now.

## I am currently learning 📚📘
* C# (Unity 2D / 3D) 
* and C++ (Unreal Engine). 
* I'm also learning italian.

## I am looking to collaborate on 🎮
Anything related to videogames would be awesome. I do not have that much experience,
but I have worked on a few projects already and I am always eager to learn 😄.
