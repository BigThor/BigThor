My name is Víctor Adrián Suárez Ruiz, but I really like my nickname Big Thor, so I use it a lot. \
I love videogames, and this made me focus my career of Computer Engineering into the video game development area.

## I am currently working on
Personal projects and courses, since I am not employed as of right now.

## I am currently learning
* C# (Unity 2D) 
* and LUA (LOVE2D and others). 
* I'm also learning italian.

## I am looking to collaborate on
Anything related to videogames would be awesome. I do not have that much experience,
but I have worked on a few projects already and I am always eager to learn.
